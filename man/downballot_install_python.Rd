\usage{
downballot_install_python(
  envname = "downballotR",
  python = NULL,
  reinstall = FALSE,
  install_chromium = TRUE,
  quiet = FALSE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{envname}{Name of the virtualenv to create/use.}

\item{python}{Path to a python executable to use when creating the env (optional).}

\item{reinstall}{If TRUE, reinstall packages even if already installed.}

\item{install_chromium}{If TRUE, install Playwright Chromium browser.}

\item{quiet}{If TRUE, suppress progress messages.}
}
\description{
Creates/uses a named virtual environment and installs Python requirements
(pandas, requests, lxml, playwright), then installs Playwright Chromium.
}
\details{
If the environment already exists and all required packages are present,
the function prints a message and returns without doing work (unless Chromium
is missing and \code{install_chromium = TRUE}). In all cases, it attempts to
initialize reticulate to the selected interpreter for this session.
}
